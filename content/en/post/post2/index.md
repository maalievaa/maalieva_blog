## Goals

- Perform 9 laboratory work on operating systems
- Perform the third stage of an individual project
- Prepare for a mathematical logic test

## How was my week?

The week passed quite productively. On Monday there were distance classes, I managed to take a little walk, do my homework on mathematical analysis and cook a delicious dinner!! On Tuesday, I did the 9th laboratory work on operating systems, it seemed quite interesting to me, there I worked with the emacs editor. Also in the evening I prepared for a test paper on mathematical logic and sorted out the last topic on analytical geometry. On Wednesday we had a test on mathematical logic, we have no results yet. Also on Wednesday, I started doing the third stage of an individual project. In the evening I took a little walk and watched my favorite TV series!

## Results

It was possible to complete all the tasks!
