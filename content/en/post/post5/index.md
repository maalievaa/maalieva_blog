## Goals

- Perform the sixth stage of an individual project on operating systems
- Do your homework on programming technology
- Study an external course on the basics of programming

## How was my week?

This week has passed easily enough. I was in my hometown - Tver, spent time with my family. From educational achievements, I managed to make the sixth stage of an individual project on operating systems, it was quite simple, but it took a long time. I have finally completed all the laboratory and all the stages of the project, I am sure that they were able to harden me and now I can work in Linux a little better. It remains to complete an external course on operating systems and there will be complete happiness in the form of pre-closed deadlines!!

## Results

It was possible to complete all the tasks!
