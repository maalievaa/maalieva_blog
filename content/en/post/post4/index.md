## How was my week?

The week passed quite productively. On Monday there were distance classes, I managed to take a little walk, do my homework on mathematical analysis and cook a delicious dinner!! I even managed to go out for a run and do a stretch! On Tuesday, I did 12 laboratory work on operating systems, it seemed quite interesting to me. Then I also managed to complete the fifth stage of the OS project. I also plan to have time to do the sixth stage of the project, as well as start the implementation of the external course. Tonight I want to have time to take a walk and watch my favorite TV series!
