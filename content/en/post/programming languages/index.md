## Scientific programming languages

Programming is often mentioned in an applied context. It seems that only mobile applications, Internet systems and special effects for movies are created with its help. But initially programming was intended for solving scientific problems. In addition, programming itself is a science, which will be useful to learn about for those who have decided to link a career with computer development.

Scientific programming is a highly oriented programming style for scientific calculations. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of the scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, as well as the predominance of efficiency over versatility.

Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies — from quantum computers to space programs — would be impossible without specialists in the field of scientific programming, able to provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.

Consider several languages:

1) Bash
Unix shell scripts, created by Ken Thompson in the early 1970s, are closely related to the programming language C. Bash - an updated Unix shell — was first released in the late 80s and is still being actively developed. Server configuration scripts are usually written on Bash, so it is a good choice for working in modern cloud environments with container storage and microservices. Shell scripts are used quite often, so knowledge of this language will come in handy. It's also worth paying attention to zsh, which is currently the default shell in macOS.

2) COBOL
One of the oldest languages still in use was created by Grace Hopper in the late 1950s and was intended to standardize the development of large-scale business applications on computers. A brilliant concept that is still used in cross-platform SDKs. An incredible 95% of ATM transactions pass through COBOL systems, and many of these devices work around the clock 365 days a year. Device vendors such as IBM are developing more powerful machines designed for COBOL, but continue to maintain and update existing systems due to the costs and risks associated with replacing them. In the near future, COBOL will not go anywhere. This is a good choice for those who want to work with clients from the financial sector.

3) C/C++
These languages often occupy the tops of various ratings — they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed by Bjorn Stroustrup in 1985. Today, these two languages underlie everything from OS and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that need low-level hardware access and performance. It takes time and some effort to master these languages.
