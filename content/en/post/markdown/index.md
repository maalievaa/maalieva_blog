## Markdown Markup Language

Markdown is a human—readable markup language that is transparently converted to HTML. It can be opened and modified in any text editor. It is widely used for writing documentations and README files. Markdown, or markdown, is a markup language for text documents. It allows you to create texts without using Word and other editors. The markup can be read and reproduced in any system or browser. Markdown was created by writer and blogger John Gruber together with web activist Aaron Schwartz. They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which the text can be translated into a beautifully designed form. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without bringing it to a "beautiful" appearance. This turned out to be Markdown. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the greatest popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS and even messengers.

What is a markdown for?

• Quick formatting of the article for translation into PDF or so that it just looks beautiful without extra effort.
• Layout of a text document for posting on the site, but without using HTML.
• Writing documentation for the code.
• Making notes in a personal digital notebook.
• Writing beautiful messages in messengers

Here are some rules:

To create a title, use the # sign, for example:
# This is heading 1 ## This is heading 2 ### This is heading 3 #### This is heading 4

To make the text bold, enclose it in double asterisks:
This text is **bold**

To set an italic font for the text, enclose it in single asterisks:
This text is *italic*.

To set bold and italicized text, enclose it in triple asterisks:
This is text is both ***bold and italic***

Citation blocks are created using the > symbol.

Markdown supports both embedding code fragments into a sentence and placing them between sentences in the form of separate fenced blocks. Fenced code blocks are an easy way to highlight syntax for code snippets. The general format of the fenced code blocks is:
``language your code goes in here ``
