## Goals

- Perform 12 and 13 laboratory work on operating systems
- Perform the fourth stage of an individual project
- A lot of walking on weekends

## How was my week?

The week passed quite productively and easily. With the return of good weather, I started running again, and also spent the weekend quite actively - I walked a lot and looked at different streets of Moscow. I also took apart a topic on mathematical analysis at the weekend, now we are studying there finding the surface area of a body using an integral. The laboratory work on the Operating systems that I planned to do turned out to be done. Soon I will go to my hometown for the weekend, I hope that there will also be good weather, and I also dream of cuddling my red cat!! In general, good weather definitely improves mood and productivity, so everything is fine!

## Results

It was possible to complete all the tasks!
