## Design of the report

The report is an opportunity to better immerse yourself in your work and analyze it better. We have a task and we record its completion in the form of a report on the work done. During training, students often make up such a document, it allows you to assess how well and how quickly the task is completed, and also makes you think about some patterns. Also, reports are often used while working in various companies, since an employee needs to report on the work done. The report may have different content - it all depends on the requirements that are put forward.
So, for example, in such a discipline as "Operating Systems", the report should include:
• Title page with the number of the laboratory work and the full name of the student.
• Formulation of the purpose of the work.
• Description of the results of laboratory work:
– description of the task being performed;
– screenshots (screen shots) recording the completion of laboratory work tasks;
– comments and conclusions on the results of the tasks.
• Description of the results of the tasks for independent work:
– description of the task being performed;
– screenshots (screen shots) that capture the completion of tasks;
– comments and conclusions on the results of the tasks.
• Conclusions agreed upon for the purpose of the work.
It is also worth noting that the report should be executed in several formats (md, docx, pdf). The md format allows you to convert both docx and pdf at once.
