## Creating presentations

A good presentation helps to understand the speaker, and a bad one only bores you. You know this if you defended your diploma at a university or listened to colleagues speak at a meeting. Unfortunately, there are more bad presentations.

It's very easy to distinguish a good presentation: it helps to keep the listeners' attention. In a bad presentation, everything is in a heap: the eyes scatter over bright slides, the brain tries to process the text, and at this time the speaker mumbles something about his own.

To make a good presentation, you don't need to be able to draw, own Photoshop and spend hours assembling slides. A good presentation is a clear presentation and a good presentation first of all. This works equally in public speeches and presentations on websites.

It is recommended that when selecting the material, immediately formulate those words or phrases that will be put on the slides. It is easy to implement this in the form of a table, where in the left column there will be information that will be conveyed to the audience orally, and in the right – materials for slides (texts, illustrations, diagrams, etc.).

Here are a few possible steps to create a presentation:

Stage 1. Statement of the purpose of the presentation

In order to get the maximum benefit from showing the presentation, the goal must be realistic and expressed in one sentence. Usually the purpose of the educational presentation coincides with the purpose of the lesson.

Stage 2. Collection and systematization of material

At this stage, it is very important not to overdo it – the material, of course, should be enough for the presentation, but remember that only the most important information should be presented on the slides.

Stage 3. Development of the presentation concept

At this stage, it is decided which type of presentation will be used (the classifications discussed earlier can be used as a basis). For example, you decide that the presentation will be linear and made in the Microsoft PowerPoint program – in this case, the available material must be arranged in such a way that the logic of the presentation is clearly visible, and the presentation itself is aimed at achieving a specific pedagogical goal.

Stage 4. Creating a presentation design

When creating the first presentations, you can limit yourself to choosing ready-made templates, later you need to come up with your own style for presentations. At this stage, it is necessary to decide which colors will prevail in the presentation, what will be the transitions between slides, etc.

Usually visually distinguish: title, main / content, slide separator (used for visual separation of presentation blocks) and final slides.

Stage 5. Content of the presentation

It is necessary to transfer materials from the second column of the table to the slides (see stage 2). Remember that in addition to the main material, slides should have headings. If you plan to use additional graphic materials (for example, arrow icons, asterisks, etc.), then at this stage you need to add them to the slides.

Stage 6. Optimization of texts and graphics

Stage 7. Layout of slides

The texts are assigned the same types of fonts and colors. The headings and texts are aligned along the guides or grid (so that when moving from one slide to another, the texts do not "jump", changing their positions). If necessary, animation effects are added to the presentation elements (they must be justified – for example, a gradual display of a diagram or stages).

Stage 8. Testing the presentation
