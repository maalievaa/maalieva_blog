## How was my week?

This week has passed easily enough. I was in my hometown - Tver, spent time with my family, we celebrated on March 8. Of the academic achievements, I managed to do 5 and 6 laboratory work on operating systems, they turned out to be simple, I coped relatively quickly. I also did programming in c++, did my homework, which was on the topic of single-linked lists and passed it. Also in the English language module we had a spring festival, I performed with my band with the song happy nation, we had quite a lot of fun!!

## Results

It was possible to complete all the tasks!
